# Sameer MK's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! This was my first attempt at building a portfolio when I was learning HTML and CSS. The site showcases my projects and provides a glimpse into my skills and interests.

## Project Overview

The project is a static website built using only HTML and CSS. While it's not fully responsive at the moment, I plan to make it responsive in the future to ensure a better user experience across various devices.
