# Sticky Wall Web Project

Welcome to my portfolio website! This was my first attempt at building a portfolio when I was learning HTML and CSS. The site showcases my projects and provides a glimpse into my skills and interests.

## Project Overview

The project is a static website built using only HTML and CSS. While it's not fully responsive at the moment, I plan to make it responsive in the future to ensure a better user experience across various devices.

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing styles for the project.

## Features

- **Sticky Wall Interface**: The main panel displays a sticky wall where sticky notes can be added in future iterations.
- **Sidebar**: The sidebar contains categories and menus for organizing sticky notes, though it is currently static and non-functional.
